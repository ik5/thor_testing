============

[Thor](http://whatisthor.com/) is a Command line parser library for Ruby, that
allow us to create a very complex requirements with minimal efforts.

The code in this repo, helps me to better understand things.
Each file contains a specific example on how to do things.

I'm using both the main site, and the
[wiki](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/wiki) to better understand things.

Further more, I'm going to explain what each file does, as a comment inside.
